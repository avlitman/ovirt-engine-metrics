ovirt_env_name: engine

# Address or hostname (FQDN) of the Elasticsearch server host.
fluentd_elasticsearch_host: elasticsearch-server.example.com

# UUID of the project/namespace used to store metrics records.
# This is used to construct the index name in Elasticsearch.
# For example, if you have ovirt_env_name: myenvname,
# then in logging OpenShift you will have a project named ovirt-metrics-myenvname.
# You need to get the UUID of this project like this:
# oc get project ovirt-metrics-myenvname -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'
ovirt_env_uuid_metrics:

# UUID of the project/namespace used to store log records.
# This is used to construct the index name in Elasticsearch.
# For example, if you have ovirt_env_name: myenvname,

# You need to get the UUID of this project like this:
# oc get project ovirt-logs-myenvname -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'
ovirt_env_uuid_logs:

# File containing the CA certificate of the CA that issued the Elasticsearch SSL server cert.
# Get it from the logging OpenShift machine like this:
# oc get secret logging-fluentd --template='{{index .data "ca"}}' | base64 -d > fluentd-ca
# and use the local_fluentd_elasticsearch_ca_file_path parameter in your ansible inventory
# or config file to pass in the file to use.

# File containing the SSL client certificate to use with certificate authentication to Elasticsearch.
# Get it from the logging OpenShift machine like this:

# File containing the SSL client key to use with certificate authentication to Elasticsearch.
# Get it from the logging OpenShift machine like this:
